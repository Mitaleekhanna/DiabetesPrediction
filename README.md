# Diabetes Prediction Dataset

## About the Dataset

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict
whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements
included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of
these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are
females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Column Description for Diabetes Data

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **Diabetes**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient has diabetes

From the dataset in the (.csv) file, we can find several variables, some of
them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target
dependent variable (Outcome).
